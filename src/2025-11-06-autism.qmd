## About

This page documents the lab's work on the question of what factors contribute to the rise in diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

## Background

On October 29, 2025, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. said that there is not "sufficient" evidence to link use of Tylenol ([acetaminophen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol)) during pregnancy to autism [@Ramaswamy2025-ro].

In April, the Centers for Disease Control released a report [@Shaw2025-hr] from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network [@CDC2025-ub].

Here is a figure to capture some of the associations:

```

### Autism diagnosis (dx) measures

@Shaw2025-hr assigned an autism diagnosis to children who met one of the following criteria:

>1) an ASD diagnostic statement in a comprehensive developmental evaluation, 2) autism special education eligibility, or 3) an ASD ICD-9 code in the 299 range or ICD-10 code of F84.0, F84.3, F84.5, F84.8, or F84.9. Children aged 4 years were classified as having suspected ASD if they did not meet the criteria for ASD but had an evaluator’s suspicion of ASD documented in a comprehensive developmental evaluation. 

- Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), @ADOS-ed
- Autism Spectrum Rating Scales (ASRS), @NaglieriUnknown-dy
- Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), @CARS-xe
- Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS), @GilliamUnknown-ik
- Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), @SRS-uj
- Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), @ADI-rm

All of the tests are available only to administrators who pay for the testing materials.

Here is a paper that compares the ADOS to the CARS: @Park2018-wq.

### Data by state

The @Shaw2025-hr supplemental data are [here](include/pdf/cdc_177099_DS2.pdf).
